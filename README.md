# Data Loading and Manipulation
1. Read the csv file from the link:
http://bit.ly/epo_automation_csv_file

2. The fields are separated using "$" delimiter
3. Get all the unique mail addresses from the csv
4. Store the last date of conversation (Different date format is kept in few of the rows, avoid those rows)
5. And write a function to determine how many days has elapsed from the date
6. Have an array which contains values like "OpenCV", "Python", and write a function that would determine whether any of the words from the array is present in the content, if it is present then that word will be stored in another column
